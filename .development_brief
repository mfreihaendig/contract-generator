# Simple Contract Generator - Development Brief

## Project Overview
A web-based tool that generates contracts in markdown format, allowing users to easily copy and paste the formatted text. The generator converts user inputs into a professional contract template that can be further customized in any markdown editor.

The tool will later be integrated with an existing simple website that consists of a static page with a tool directory and various other simple tools, each with their own contained setup.
